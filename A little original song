A little original song

G (down, up down)  Cmaj7 (down)
G (down, up down)  Cmaj7 (down)
Em (down, up down) Am (down)
Em (Em + pinkie on 5th fret of A string, then 4th)
F (down, up down)
(all strings open but mute A string) (down, up down)
D (down, up down up down, up down up) G
then either repeat with Cmaj7, or end on a happy note with C
