The Rainbow Connection

G - C - G - C

G                Em
Why are there so many

Am          D
songs about rainbows

    G
and what's on the

Em    C
other side

G            Em
Rainbows are visions

    Am    D
but only illusions

    G
and rainbows have

Em         C
nothing to hide

C7
So we've been told and
some choose to believe it

F#m
I know they're wrong, wait and see

Am            D
Someday we'll find it

Am              D7
The lovers, the dreamers,

and me
